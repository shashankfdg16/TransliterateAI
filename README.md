# TransliterateAI
AI based Multilingual transliteration and OCR framework

TransliterateAI is an AI driven project that is designed to recognise multiple regional languages and transliterate into another target language of User's choice.

India has always been a land of many languages flourishing together.
The multitude of scripts thrived and have been instrumental in the preservation of knowledge without losing continuity.
However, in todays world many people are unable to read signboards, directions, or notices written in local script - helping users read the same content in their own familiar script.
for example
A person from Andhra Pradesh should be able to read road signs in Marathi through Telugu script.
A pilgrim from Kerala visiting Tirupati should be able to understand signboards in Telugu through Malayalam script.
